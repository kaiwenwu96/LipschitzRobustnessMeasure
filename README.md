Estimating the robustness of several deep neural networks on MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets.

To approximate distances to decision boudaries, we use smapling method to estimate Lipschitz constant bound. The approach is similar to the method proposed in [Evaluating the Robustness of Neural Networks: An Extreme Value Theory Approach](https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkUHlMZ0b)
